                                                        # Restful-API
Rest stands for : Representational state transfer.
Rest enables to communicate between client and server that runs on HTTP protocols is a architecture model.    
Rest is an architectural style for designing APIs and it's not only one.  
It uses HTTP Request verbs such as **Get,Post,Put,Patch,Delete**  
Uses specific routes(/home,/about).  

```
npm install express,body-parser,mongoose,ejs  
```
What I did and learn ?  
I did a little example that we have nosql database and we can make *CRUD* process on postman with our node server.  

I learned Postman, Mongodb,Mongoose. I feel more comfortable with nodejs,express and I used chained route handlers technique 
```
app.route().get().post().put().delete().  
```
